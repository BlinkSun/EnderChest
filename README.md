==========
Keep your stuffs anywhere !


**EnderChests** are a type of chest that can store items. They function the same as normal chests, except that their contents are shared across all other **EnderChests** placed anywhere, even in different worlds.

**EnderChests** do not drop their contents when broken. Items placed inside will remain present even if all instances of them are destroyed, and can be accessed by placing a new EnderChest.

**EnderChests** cannot be made into double chests and cannot be placed adjacent to another chest.
